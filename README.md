# PHP-Based E-commerce Website

## Overview
This repository contains files for a basic PHP-based e-commerce website. The website allows users to register, login, browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed with the checkout process. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to explore various products and make purchases online.

The website is built using PHP for server-side scripting, HTML for markup, CSS for styling, and MySQL for database management. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for organized code structure and separation of concerns.

Key features of the website include:
- **User Registration and Login:** Users can create an account by registering with their email and password. Registered users can then log in to access additional features.
- **Product Catalog:** The website displays a catalog of products available for purchase, including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the items in the cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed.
- **Checkout Process:** Once users have selected their desired items, they can proceed to the checkout process to enter shipping details, select payment methods, and confirm their orders.
- **Database Integration:** The website utilizes a MySQL database to store user information, product details, cart contents, and order history.
